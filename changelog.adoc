## iZettle API Changelog

### 2020-09-21

Update documentation.

#### Finance API

- Remove the `SUBSCRIPTION_CHARGE` transaction type. This transaction was incorrectly added to the documentation.
- Clarify that `VOUCHER_ACTIVATION` does not appear on the liquid account.
- Mark the `TELL_FRIEND` transaction type as deprecated. This transaction type was removed in late 2018, but may show up in transactions prior to that.

#### Purchase API

- Remove the `CUSTOM` payment type. This payment type does not exist anymore and has not been in use.

#### Product Library API

- Update example request under the "Create product" section to reflect the new `category` and `variantOptionDefinitions` fields.
  The `category` field replaces the old `categories` field. Now, a product may only have one category assigned to it. To create a new product category, simply provide a new UUID (v1) value on the `category.uuid` field when creating or updating a product.
- Add example request under the "Update product" section.
- Add docs about Product Categories.
